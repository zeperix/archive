### Update 20/02 - Patched from hackerone report, reflectors now at **790** ! (Scan from Aug 2020)

---

- Steam In-Home Streaming allows streaming and playing games from one PC to another or with friends (on the internet).
- The Request for info packet reveals hostname, internal IP's and MAC addresses which amplify the initial request.
- If no response to the reply within 5 seconds, this protocol will send the data again (some kind of UDP error retry mechanism).
  - **Same data is sent 3 times before giving up.**
    - Instantly, after 3s, then after 20s.
  - This is more interesting (and potentially dangerous) than singleton data overflowing into fragments because it is an entirely new packet.

### Example Request / Response

- Request: 17 bytes (1x)

### Mitigations

- Stop allowing default Internet access (yet again...), restrict to LAN as default configuration (Steam's issue).
- Response data ALWAYS consists of Steam's proprietary `\xff\xff\xff\xff` query prefix.
- Data size and data itself vary greatly depending on internal addresses and connected device MAC addresses, responses can range from 50 bytes to 400 in a single packet.
